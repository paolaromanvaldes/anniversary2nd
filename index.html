            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <div class="story">
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who met a beautiful young man in the city of love. The instant that she laid eyes on him she knew that he would be one of the most special people in her life. She watched him from afar, as she knew that the start of a foreign love would be very risky. One fateful night, her friends devised a plan to bring the girl and the man together. While she knew that if she engaged with the beautiful foreign man she would fall deeply in love with him, being near him and not speaking to him was unbearable. With some courage, she sat down next to him and nervously asked, "What's your favorite animal?"</p>

        <p>After so much love and energy given to one another, the young man and the girl started to become not only best friends, but lovers as well. They communicated every day and began to long for every time that they would be reunited once more. They became very strong and lovingly entwined in each other lives. With each adventure that passed, they loved each other more and more.  They travelled thousands of miles to be with each other. The young man even boarded his flirst aeroplane flight to the new continent. They laughed while exploring Copenhagen, they dined in Mexico City, and they even visited the all hailed museum of ABBA. While apart, the young couple encouraged each other to become the best version of themselves possible, thrusting themselves onto enducation once more.  they The young couple shared many laughs and cries while together and apart from each other, but they knew that each laugh and each cry would be another one closer to being together. </p>
